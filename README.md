# Egg Timer
## A note from Zakir Ufuk (Please Read);  

In this project I will try to make an Egg Timer. Project description and new technologies that I will first use is stated below. 

Now that I have finished the project, I would like to edit this. I wrote that I will use the technologies below (in original readme.md file) but I am happy to say that I have used more funtions/technologies then expected, with the last commit I have added more features to the project. Extra things that I have added stated below. It took a lot of time and effort but I have learned a lot from it! 
* digital timer to display remaining time after user selects egg hardness
* stop button to stop alarm when eggs are ready (which also resets every setting (progress bar, variables, timer etc) and return backs to starting point)
* flash effect which turns on when the eggs are ready 
* different labels for before choosing egg hardness , when egg is cooking, when egg is ready time periods 

## Our Goal

This module will be a mix of tutorials and challenges. Most importantly, we want you to get comfortable with looking up how to do something you've never done before. In certain places of this module, you’ll need to follow the 5 step process you learnt in the Xylophone module and use Google search, StackOverflow and Apple Documentation to make your code do what you want it to. But there are also other parts where we’ll take you step-by-step through new Swift programming concepts. 

## What You'll Make

You’ll be building a beautiful egg timer app to boil your eggs to perfection depending on how you prefer your eggs. 

## What you will learn

* Swift Collection types - Dictionaries
* The Swift Timer API
* Conditional statements - IF/ELSE
* Conditional statements - Switch
* Functions with outputs
* How to use the ProgressView
